# NJ Accidents Data Analysis
This project was done for my Big Data Tools and Techniques class in the spring of 2022.

## Purpose
- Find an uncleaned dataset that contains over 250,000 rows.
- Host the data in an AWS S3 Bucket
- Import the data into Databricks
- Clean the data and have it stored back in the S3 bucket
- Use AWS Athena to connect the cleaned data to Tableau
- Create charts and queries to visualize and analyze the data

## Part 1: The Data
The data I choose for this project is a collection of accidents reported in NJ from 2017 to 2018 found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek1711/new-jersey-2018-accidents-data).
